structure-types:
  - name: segment
    objects: [first, last] # segment.first etc.
  - name: grid
    derivatives:
      - name: x-axis
        type: order
      - name: y-axis
        type: order

representation-types:
  - name: gui
    structures:
      - name: screen
        affects: points
        covered-by: regions
    # objects: [regions, vline, hline, rect, text] # etc... Do I need to say that 'regions' is the basic?
    objects: [regions, regions.vline, regions.hline, regions.rect, regions.text] # use . to declare subset in place (probably need different symbol)

behavior-types:
  - name: mouse
    behaviors: [click, down, up, move, drag] # events (huh, analogous to objects)
    structures:
      - name: mousepad # weirdly hard to name this
        type: twodim
        structures: [move, drag]
  - name: keyboard
    behaviors: [key, q, w, e, r, t, y, cmd+q, cmd+w, cmd+e, cmd+r, cmd+t, cmd+y] # etc. (definitely a cleaner way to do this)
