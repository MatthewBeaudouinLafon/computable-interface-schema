notes:
  - I tried to write this spec by working backwards from the representations
    - a bit tricky because I do need to refer to the model event though it doesn't exist yet eg. 'I guess I'll have pages.current->blocks'
    - it'd be cool to have a list of "dangling" relations eg. structures used in a representation that don't exist yet. That way you can keep track of
    what's missing
    - as I write a lot of page.current->blocks and such, I get a pressure to abstract page into a component. Then I just need to replace `->` with `/`
  - indenting representations for hierarchy is interesting
    - I do keep adding in the wrpong place and getting lost, so I removed it
  - the `page` component suggests that maybe we still need a bunch of object relations... but I guess merging the declaration with the use is a good way
    to limit the amount of novel notation.
  - still slightly struggling to talk about links (to other pages) as related to the hierarchical structure. Seems like a general awkwardness around talking
    abour properties when they reify structure (kind of how mapping to timestamps induces a temporal structure)
    - the solution is to make a "dummy" object in the component, then link it a the top level (where they're both instantiated). It's a bit awkward.
    - comment authors have a similar move; comments aren't associated with authors until users are instantiated
  - (meta) it's actually pretty cool to leave a note in the middle of the spec, so the parser should seek those out
  - describing edits in detail is ... rough. I'm definitely missing a conceptual model to do this well. 
    - in particular, saying how a text selection becomes a comment-highlight, which creates a comment, which you need to write text into... it's a mess.
    - where does the behavior go? I first wrote stuff at the top level, only to realize it was only accessing stuff in an item.
  - one downside to the representation syntax is that it hides the obj->repr-obj relation, which means it's not obvious that you can exploit `obj->repr-obj` eg. for hit-testing
