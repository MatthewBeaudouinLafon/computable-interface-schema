The semantics suggests a container of stuff, and imposes structure on that stuff.
If the 

Bluefish does this by making the structure a container, let's try that.

<!-- first stab at views -->
<tiny-month-view type="gui" hstack-wrapped="core.time">
    <text>months.active->days</text>
    <text>something-else</text>
</tiny-month-view>

<week-view type="gui" mark="regions" <day-view type="gui" encoding="core.time" marks="">
    core.timestamps
    </day-view>

</week-view>

<!-- hmmm what if we actually lean in
This uses a container metaphor for structures.

Notes:
- What's the type of the thing that goes inside a <thing></thing>? 
  In this version it's contextual, which is not ideal... 
  How does Bluefish do this again?
- The whole point of this operation is to be able to substitute a reference for
  a complete block of spec (so you can just move forward). 
  This requires a certain kind of composition from the syntax.
  - Dev's functional approach works well for this
  - the HTML thing is wonky because there are different types of outgoing edges.
- The container model for objects is pretty slick to talk about component contents.
  I was kind of headed that direction with yaml 6.0

Ok so what's the model here?

object:
    name: var-name      # no nesting
    type: obj-type      # could define inline, but that's excessive, especially with "contents"

    contents:
        - anything      # obviously nesting, or refs

structure:
    name: var-name      # no nesting
    type: struct-type   # could define inline
    
    affects: object     # could define inline
    cover:   object     # could define inline
    
    mapto: struct       # define struct inline
    constrains: struct  # define struct inline
    
view:
    name: var-name      # no nesting
    type: view-type     # could define inline?? eg. for hardware device

    marks:
        view-objects: object   # no nesting (comes from view-type)
        model-object: object   # could define inline

    encodings

Differences with Bluefish
- Bluefish is a scenegraph with a few extra edges, making the nesting + ref thing work pretty well. ISN/Mirabelle is a lot less hierarchical â€” though if you do a nesting thing you develop a spanning tree.
- ISN has typed edges, where as Bluefish is mostly about containment.
- Each bluefish node can be a "potentially empty" view, so syntactically structures and objects have the same type, making easier to nest things.

The chunking visually sucks because you get too many indents.
