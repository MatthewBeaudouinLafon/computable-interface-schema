    - /files =: files.open

- (gui) editors:
    - /marks: tab-groups/view
    - /encoding.layout: _ # some combination of hstack and vstack defined by the user...

- (gui) open-editors-view:
    - /marks.text: files
    - /encoding.group: tab-group=>files #

- notes:
    - it feels like coloring stuff based on a group is important.
    - very common pattern of creating a structure after an encoding that affects the object mapped to the mark.
      this could be improved syntactically?
    - still not sure how to do container as group
