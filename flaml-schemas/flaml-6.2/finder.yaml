- notes:
    - it's kind of possible to defined folders through a recursive container, but it's bad.
    - huh, folders are also a kind of cover over the tree (ie. its immediate children)
    - parents-path feels a bit hacky, but I don't think I want to go into much more detail. Using it is a bit messy though...
