- def-container (day):
    - (gui) view:
        - /marks.hline: timestamps
        - /marks.rectangles: events
        - /encoding.vstack: time

- (day) days:
    - /timestamps =: timestamps
    - /events =: days->events
    - /time =:
        (linear) time:
          affects: timestamps
          covers: days, weeks, months, events

- (gui) week-view:
    - /marks.regions: days/view
    - /encoding.hstack: time

- notes:
    - seems really easy to forget to connect the contents of a container to the outside, especially if they share a name.
    - when the container is grouping stuff outside, it's kind of weird. How do you make them agree? days->events doesn't say what I want it to say.
