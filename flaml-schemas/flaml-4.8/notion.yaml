notes:
  - architecting the components is kind of tricky. Like, how do I optionally have state? I guess I can just have different
    types of blocks
  - mapfrom means you could leave the provenance of hstack open ended with a variable.
    Barring that, it's feels like "oh yeah, where does that come from?"
  - a bit unfortunate that the semantics for the commutative square of representation aren't actually realized in this notation.
    But that wouldn't help with metaphorical mapping anyway.
  - when I'm embedding a component's view in another view, what should I map it to? regions is the safe bet, but meh
  - how do I talk about comments floating in the right place? This feels like a problem of representing substraty things again...
  - if I have non-mutually-exclusive subsets in contains, how do I look at the intersection of two sets?
    - maybe `page.active->page.top-level` = active top level page
    - `pages.active.top-level` technically this is still valid? since `pages.active` is just a set of pages. That implies you can do pages.active.active.active...
  - still a bit awkward to have structures named and instantiated just to be used once. Is there a similar move to `contains` that I can do?
  - combining views is a particularly awkward mess... maybe that could be fixed with a better gui abstraction
    - notably we probably don't get a lot out of seeing how the views are put together. That's not a mind melting metaphor, and it's more easily captured with a screenshot
