        structures: timestamps
        mapto: scrubber_view.hstack # use horizontal structure

notes:
  - missing mapto-many for text mapto-many alphabet
  - .`number` is awkward because I want to use it as a single thing, but I have to reach into it to get 'the number'"
    - maybe I can have a "promoted" field that behaves like "shared". So when you use the component,
    you're actually referring to that thing
